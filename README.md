# Angular Spotify

A simple Spotify client built with Angular 12, Nx workspace, ngrx, TailwindCSS and ng-zorro.

> I have recently shared about #angularspotify at [AngularAir](https://angularair.com), you can watch the session here üëâ [youtu.be/uPB0KHKlrU8][02-air]

## Working application

Check out the **live application** -> https://spotify.trungk18.com

**Spotify premium** is required for the Web Playback SDK to play music. If you are using a free account, you can still browse the app, but it couldn't play the music. Sorry about that ü§£

## Who is it for ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I still remember Window Media Player on windows has the visualization when you start to play the music, and I wanted to have the same experience when listening to Spotify. That is the reason I started this project.

I found that there weren't many resources on building a proper real-world scale application, and that's my focus for sharing. I made a [Jira clone application][jira] as the first one for that purpose. [Nx workspace][nx] is getting more and more attention from the Angular community, but people are always confused about how to architect and set up an Nx project. I hope Angular Spotify will give you more insight on that even though it is my first project using Nx ü§£

You know I am one of the moderators of [Angular Vietnam][angularvn]. Recently, I also started [Angular Singapore][angularsg]. This piece of work is my other long-term plan to bring Angular knowledge to more people. I desire to advocate and grow the Angular developer community in Singapore and Vietnam :)

## Tech stack

- [Angular 12][angular]
- [Nx Workspace][nx]
- [ngneat][] packages includes: `ngneat/svg-icon` and `ngneat/until-destroy`
- [ngrx][ngrx] and [ngrx/component-store][component-store]
- [ng-zorro][ng-zorro] UI component: `tooltip`, `modal`, `slider`, `switch` and more.
- [TailwindCSS][tailwind] - See this video [Everything you need to know about TailwindCSS and Angular applications](https://youtu.be/zSXdJqEPy9w) by [@nartc][nartc] for integration TailwindCSS with Angular
- [Netlify][netlify] for deployment

I experimented with the ngrx/component store for `AuthStore` and `UIStore`. It might not be a best practice, and I will refactor it very soon. Just FYI ü§£

## High-level design

See my original notes on [Nx workspace structure for NestJS and Angular][gist]

### Principles

All components are following:

- OnPush Change Detection and async pipes: all components use observable and async pipe for rendering data without any single manual subscribe. Only some places are calling subscribe for dispatching an action, which I will have a refactor live stream session with my friend [@nartc][nartc] to use the component store for a fully subscribe-less application.
- SCAMs (single component Angular modules) for tree-shakable components, meaning each component will have a respective module. For example, a RegisterComponent will have a corresponding RegisterModule. We won't declare RegisterComponent as part of AuthModule, for instance.
- Mostly, everything will stay in the `libs` folder. New modules, new models, new configurations, new components etc... are in libs. libs should be separated into different directories based on existing apps. We won't put them inside the apps folder. For example in an Angular, contains the `main.ts`, `app.component.ts` and `app.module.ts`

### Structure

I followed the structure recommended by my friend [@nartc][nartc]. Below is the simplified version of the application structure.

```
.
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ root
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ apps
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ angular-spotify
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ libs

            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ settings (dir)
            ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature (angular:lib) - for configure and persist all settings
            ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ data-access (workspace:lib) - store and services for settings module
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ playlist (dir)
            ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data-access (angular:lib, service, state management)

            ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ui (dir)
            ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ playlist-track (angular:lib, SCAM for Component)
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ visualizer (dir)
            ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data-access (angular:lib)
            ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature
            ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ui (angular:lib)
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ home (dir)
            ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data-access (angular:lib)
            ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature (angular:lib)
            ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ui (dir)
            ‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ featured-playlists (angular:lib, SCAM for Component)
            ‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ greeting (angular:lib, SCAM for Component)
            ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ recent-played (angular:lib, SCAM for Component)
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ shared (dir)
                ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app-config (injection token for environment)
                ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data-access (angular:lib, API call, Service or State management to share across the Client app)
                ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui (dir)
                ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pipes (dir)
                ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ directives (dir)
                ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils (angular:lib, usually shared Guards, Interceptors, Validators...)
```

### Authentication Flow

I follow `Implicit Grant Flow` that Spotify recommended for client-side only applications and did not involve secret keys. The issued access tokens are short-lived, and there are no refresh tokens to extend them when they expire.

View the [Spotify Authorization Guide](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/)

- Upon opening Angular Spotify, It will redirect you to Spotify to get access to your data. Angular Spotify only uses the data purely for displaying on the UI. We won't store your information anywhere else.
- Angular Spotify only keeps the access token in the browser memory without even storing it into browser local storage. If you do a hard refresh on the browser, It will ask for a new access token from Spotify. One access token is only valid for **one hour**.
- After having the token, I'll try to connect to the Web Playback SDK with a new player - `Angular Spotify Web Player`

![Angular Spotify Web Playback SDK flow][sdk-flow]

### Dependency Graph

Nx provides an [dependency graph][dep-graph-nx] out of the box. To view it on your browser, clone my repository and run:

```bash
npm run dep-graph
```

A simplified graph looks like the following. It gives you insightful information for your mono repo and is especially helpful when multiple projects depend on each other.

![Angular Spotify Dependency Graph][dep-graph]

### Nx Computation Cache

Having Nx Cloud configured shortens the deployment time quite a lot.

Nx Cloud pairs with Nx in order to enable you to build and test code more rapidly, by up to 10 times. Even teams that are new to Nx can connect to Nx Cloud and start saving time instantly. Visit [Nx Cloud](https://nx.app/) to learn more.

## Time spending

It is a side project that I only spent time outside of the office hours to work on. I initially planned to complete the project within two weeks, but the first two weekends were not very productive, maybe because of the holiday mood from Lunar New Year :) But once the lego blocks are getting together, I feel the rhythm, and I know it has to be finished by the end of March.

I couldn't get the full-time report from waka time because it only shows me the latest two weeks. ü§£

I have spent approximately 50 hours working on this project, which is almost the same amount as the first version of [jira.trungk18.com][jira].

The visualizer was the most exciting feature, and I decided to start this project because of that single component.

![Angular Spotify - Time spending][time]

### Accessibility ‚ôø

Not all components have properly defined [aria attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA), visual focus indicators, etc.

## Setting up the development environment üõ†

- `git clone https://github.com/trungk18/angular-spotify.git`
- `cd angular-spotify`
- `npm start` for starting Angular web application
- The app should run on `http://localhost:4200/`

### Unit/Integration tests üß™

I skipped writing test for this project.

## Compatibility

Web Playback SDK supports Chrome, Firefox, Edge, IE 11, or above running on Mac/Windows/Linux.

It **doesn't support** Safari or any mobile browser on **Android** or **iOS**
